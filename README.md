# RuneAdvantage

A client game created with the purpose of one-upping that pesky trader!

## Why build it?

Wanted to challenge myself to build a client using just DOM elements.
There are no SVGs or `<canvas>` graphics anywhere in the program

All graphics are rendered as React functional components, and the game logic is handled by a Redux reducer.

## Where is it?

Here you dummy!

## How to get it?

Clone and run it locally.

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```
